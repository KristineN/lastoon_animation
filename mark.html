												<strong>Story outline 1</strong><br>

													Once Mark forgets to close the doors to his secret lab and intruders – his younger sister Lucy and her
													pet Tony sneak into it and instantly make a mess there. They actuate brand new invention - Recliner
													of professions by chance which has not been tested yet. Its display showed: “Confectioner” and all
													three of them are teleported in IX century to the kitchen of Arabic sultan where at that time Confectioners’ competition takes place. At once our characters become participants of such
													competition. But they have three main problems:<br>
													&nbsp;&nbsp; ● they run out of time till the end of the competition and it is the Sultan himself who will evaluate quality of sweet treats<br>
													&nbsp;&nbsp; ● guards which are watching everyone and give them shivers<br>
													&nbsp;&nbsp; ● it’s obligatory to prepare confectionery as a team.<br>
													But instead of joining forces Mark and Lucy begin to argue and compete for being team leader and Tony is trying to steal confectionery from their rivals and take credit for it as their own. Conflict grows and there is almost no time left. Tony was the first to realize that defeat may threaten their safety and tries to persuade them into acting together. Mark and Lucy agree.<br>
													New method changes everything: they have coped with the task together. And at the moment when
													the Sultan tastes their work and approves it, the Recliner returns our characters back to the lab. The
													kids are excited that they are at home and had such unexpected adventure which makes them a little
													bit closer as teamwork unites people.

												<strong>Story outline 2</strong><br>

												Mark has a theory how the Recliner chooses a profession: basically, you need to throw something
												related to the profession to “jelly liquid – time converter” but figures also showed that energy of his
												body is not enough to travel in time. And it’s necessary so that Lucy and Tony take part in process to
												actuate the Recliner. So, he has to invite them to his lab again. But he keeps silent about his
												inventions and offers new adventure. Mark discreetly throws thermometer for animals in tank with jelly
												liquid and the characters appear in a vet school in Ancient Egypt. At that time, approx. 3000 years
												ago, people taught how to treat animals and received many of them to cure. Cleopatra’s favorite tabby
												becomes their patient. The Ruler liked amazing creature Tony at once and she threatened to take it
												away in case if her tabby didn’t get well. Lucy fears to lose her friend and she begs Mark to solve the
												problem. He started to make herbal tea, extracts and infusions trying to discover new medicine. Lucy
												notices pictures on the walls which describe various medical cases and goes along them to find
												relevant information. She bravely passes dark corridor with traps and even encounters a mummy to
												rescue her friend.

												Mark has dreamed of new device for his lab which is very expensive and he can’t afford to buy it.
												That’s why he decides to find out secrets of old master mechanics with his Recliner. They could make
												do on very little in their inventions and Mark wants to know how they managed to do it. Mark drops
												wrench to the tank with jelly liquid and our characters appear at the arena of the Colosseum where
												chariot races are about to start.<br>
												There is a reward offered to win the races: 1 st place – gold vase, 2 nd place - 10 slaves. Mark considers
												that he could sell gold vase in his time and buy the device he needs. But Liza notices miserable
												slaves and understands that if they win 2 nd place she’ll be able to release them. So, she offers her
												brother to take part in the races and he agrees although he has other reward in his mind. Mark and
												Toney steps in the chariot and start races whereas Lucy helps as mechanic.<br>
												Mark and Tony are driven by greed for gain and manage not only to handle their vehicle but also
												block their rivals. Tony showed its dark nature. Lucy is amazingly talented mechanic and mends
												chariot using unconventional solutions as hair binders and chewing gum. They are ahead of all rivals
												but in the nick of time Mark decides that lives of miserable slaves are more valuable and lets his rival
												go ahead. They take honorary second place and release the slaves.<br>
												The Recliner brings the kids back. They are glad that they have helped people gain freedom. In his
												room Mark finds gold vase which Tony stole from under winner’s nose so he could buy precious device.

												spaceships as there are cars on Earth. Mark operates spaceship as if he did it many times before. He
												offers Lucy to try it as well but Lucy flatly refuses. Suddenly they detect huge meteorite moving

												<strong>Story outline 5</strong><br>

												Having looked at photos of girls from her school in social networks Lucy decides that her hair-do is not
												classy enough. She wants to share her resentment with Mark and finds him in the lab as he drops
												various things in jelly liquid and the display shows respective professions. She asks Mark to send her
												to the best hair dressers in the world history to make all her class mates envy.<br>
												The kids appear in XVII century – epoch of “Ludovics”, Dukes and Duchesses – in a fascinating castle
												where they make acquaintance with the king. The latter is looking forward to hosting very important
												event: visit of the king of other country. The king is dressing up for the visit and trying on various head
												wear: from Viking’s helmet to bonnet with veil to conceal his red hair. According to him such color was
												not trendy at that time and he was the only red head in the whole kingdom.<br>
												Lucy has a solution and asks to give her the following things: wool fleece, needle, threads, big nail
												and also to light a fire. Lucy swiftly made a superb wig and then heated nail and curled a couple of
												locks on it. Ludovic wore the wig and is extremely excited about it. The reception starts,
												representative of other country has arrived but when window suddenly opens, both kings have lost
												their wigs and it turns out that they are both red heads.<br>
												When she returns, Lucy tells that she didn’t want to pretend and it’s important to accept yourself as
												you are and ignore inconsistent fashion.
